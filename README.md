# Waterfall (Physics and Animation Coursework)

In this assignment the primary focus is to apply some of the topics covered in class to create a valid
piece that can be incorporated in the big group project (Go Fission). So I decided that I wanted to 
experiment with Waterfall effects and the use of Particle Systems. One of the problems faced during the
development of this project is that the big project has to be done in Unreal which I donÂ´t have much 
experience with, so this is one of the main challenges, be familiar with the application and create a 
good solid work to be used in the other project.

# 1. SPARKS Particle System



First step to follow the tutorial of Unreal to create a waterfall.

Concepts to understand in unreal:

Panner
Depth Fade
Fresnel
1 minus function, just return the opposite of the variable, function or method. Invert the fresnel to start refracting around the edges more.
Constant of a material
